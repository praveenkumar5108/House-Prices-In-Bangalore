# House-Prices-In-Bangalore
step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website
We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using the Banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. The second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve Http requests. The third component is the website built in Html, CSS, and javascript that allows users to enter the home square ft area, bedrooms, etc and it will call the python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building, we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation, etc.
